    "Once upon a time there was a young farmer whose name was Toba. He lived in a valley which land was fertile, therefore he was able to support his life by the crops he grew although he was not a rich man.",
    "One day, he felt like he wanted to eat fish so he went fishing at a river not far from his house. The river was usually rich with fish, but on that strange day he did not catch any fish for a long time, so he decided to just go home. Just as he was preparing to leave, his rod and line still in the water caught a big fish. As he lifted the fish, it suddenly talked. The fish cried and begged him to release it.",
    "Surprised to see a talking fish, he released it to the river, but suddenly the fish transformed into beautiful young woman. The young woman said that she was actually a princess cursed to be a fish. She thanked the young farmer for breaking her curse and to show her gratitude, she was willing to be his wife under the condition that the farmer should not tell anybody about her being a fish once or a terrible disaster would be fallen on him. So the farmer and the woman got married and after a while the woman gave birth to a baby boy. The boy grew up to be a child of great appetite. He was always hungry and would eat all the food at the table and would not even leave any food for his parents to eat."
